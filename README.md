# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

- Ruby version

- System dependencies

- Configuration

- Database creation

- Database initialization

- How to run the test suite

- Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

- Deployment instructions

- ...

# Tramy's guidelines:

## ActionController

- Add a brief description if the method becomes complex

## ActiveRecord

- Follow the order: associations, validations, scopes, callbacks.
- For printing queries in rails console, after throwing a search, type: ap \_ to see a friendly result (development-only)
